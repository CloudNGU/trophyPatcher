# trophyPatcher
Make games incompatible with TROPHAX work.

This program works by taking the trophy set of an incompadile game and making it load in a compadible one,
from there you just need to run TROPHAX and you can unlock all trophies in that game!

What you need:

The NPWR folder (can be any%).
ur0:user/00/trophy/data/NPWRXXXX

The Decrypted .TRP (use VitaShell's "Open Decrypted" on the app folder, or Mai/Vitamin)
ux0:app/PCSXXXXX/sce_sys/trophy/TROPHY.TRP


Open the program, when prompted select the NPWR folder, 
then select the decrypted TRP, and finally a place to save the patched VPK.

this will create a patched copy of the game RETRO CITY RAMPAGE DX
(smallest game i could find that had trophys, alot of files removed to reduce filesize, its basicly unplayable, but works for this purpose!)

once your on the title screen run TROPHAX and youll see trophys of the incompadible game unlock!

(if you get an NP error followed by "Cannot Start The Application, on the modded game, delete the origianl trophy set from ur0:user/00/trophy!)
