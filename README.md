# trophyPatcher
Make games incompatible with TROPHAX work.

This program works by taking the trophy set of an incompadile game and making it load in a compadible one,
from there you just need to run TROPHAX and you can unlock all trophies in that game!

What you need:

The NPWR folder (can be any%).
ur0:user/00/trophy/data/NPWRXXXX OR the decrypted eboot.bin of the game (doesnt allways work!)

The Decrypted .TRP (use VitaShell's "Open Decrypted" on the app folder, or Mai/Vitamin)
ux0:app/PCSXXXXX/sce_sys/trophy/TROPHY.TRP


Open the program, when prompted select the NPWR folder, 
then select the decrypted TRP, and finally a place to save the patched VPK.

this will create a patched copy of the NP_TROPHY sample.

Press X to run the sample, wait for trophys to setup and run trophax OR. press X and unlock whatever trophy you want,
you dont NEED trophax to use this!

(if you get an NP-6183-8, error followed by "Cannot Start The Application", on the modded game, delete the origianl trophy set from ur0:user/00/trophy/data/!)
